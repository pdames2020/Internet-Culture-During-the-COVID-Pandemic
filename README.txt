This is a collection of things found on the internet during the pandemic. Criteria for adding something:

1. Photo, video, social media post, etc. from the Internet.
2. Shows something unique to the coronavirus (ie. how people are coping, how people are attempting to be social during social
isolation, how people are going to school during quarantine, etc.)
3. Please add the date you found it and maybe a little description.

That's it. Hopefully this can be a weird archive for people studying the pandemic from a historical standpoint in the future.
